# DeepLearningModel_Acne_Melanoma_Detection
Convolutionary Neural Network model train to detect Skin diseases and conditions like Melanoma, Acne, Psioriasis.

## Project Goals 
- To create and train a robust CNN model to recognize major skin diseases and conditions.
- To implement an interface where users could upload pictures and get a reliable diagnosis
- Make the tool available for professionals (dermatologists).

## Main focus
- Main focus is on Acne skin conditions : We want the model to recognize the exact type of Acne.
- Bias reduction : We want to make sure the model is trained on all skin colors and skin types as well on differents body parts.
